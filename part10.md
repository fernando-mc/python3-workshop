# A Complete Beginner's Introduction to Python

## Part 10

### Modules

Let's create our own module! For this we'll need to:

1. Come up with some functionality we want to encapsulate into a function.
2. Save that function and any `import` statements it requires in a new file that ends with `.py`
3. Open up the Python interpreter and import that file by running `import filename` where `filename` is the name of the file *without* the `.py` on the end.
4. Run the function by entering in `filename.functioname()` and entering any parameters it requires!
